# 📌 POV-Display
Persistence of Vision (POV) is an optical phenomenon where an image remains on the retina for a short time even after the object is no longer visible.
This project implements a POV Display using an Arduino Nano and a rotating set of LEDs. By leveraging the phenomenon where an image remains on the retina for ~1/16th of a second, it creates the illusion of characters or symbols floating in the air.
