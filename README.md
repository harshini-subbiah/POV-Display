# POV-Display
Persistence of Vision (POV) is an optical phenomenon where an image remains on the retina for a short time even after the object is no longer visible. By leveraging this phenomenon with an Arduino Nano and LEDs arranged on a rotating platform, we can create the illusion of characters and symbols appearing in mid-air.
